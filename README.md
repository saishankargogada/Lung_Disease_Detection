Lung Disease Detection Model using Convolutional Neural Networks

Respiratory Disease Classification (CNN-MFCC)
• Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of respiratory diseases based on audio
data analysis.
• Utilized Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction from audio data, a powerful technique for
capturing essential characteristics in sound.
• Achieved early diagnosis of respiratory diseases, leading to significant improvements in treatment outcomes and patient
care.
• Gained hands-on experience in implementing deep learning techniques for audio data analysis. Expanded proficiency in
neural network architecture design and signal processing methods.
• Contributed to advancements in medical diagnostics and demonstrated a strong commitment to improving healthcare
through technology.
